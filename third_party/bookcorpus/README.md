# Homemade BookCorpus

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

**Recently, clawling seems difficult. Consider another option like using [files hosted by unknown](https://github.com/soskek/bookcorpus/issues/24#issuecomment-556024973) at your own risk.**

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

-----------------

These are scripts to reproduce BookCorpus by yourself.

[BookCorpus](http://yknzhu.wixsite.com/mbweb) is a popular large-scale text corpus, espetially for unsupervised learning of sentence encoders/decoders. However, BookCorpus is no longer distributed...

This repository includes a crawler collecting data from [smashwords.com](https://www.smashwords.com/books/category/1/downloads/0/free/medium/0), which is the original source of BookCorpus.
Collected sentences may partially **differ** but the number of them will be larger or almost the same. If you use the new corpus in your work, please specify that it is a replica.

## How to use

Prepare URLs of available books. However, this repository already has a list as `url_list.jsonl` which was a snapshot I (@soskek) collected on Jan 19-20, 2019. You can use it if you'd like.

```
python -u download_list.py > url_list.jsonl &
```

Download their files. Downloading is performed for `txt` files if possible. Otherwise, this tries to extract text from `epub`. The additional argument `--trash-bad-count` filters out `epub` files whose word count is largely different from its official stat (because it may imply some failure).

```
python download_files.py --list url_list.jsonl --out out_txts --trash-bad-count
```

The results are saved into the directory of `--out` (here, `out_txts`).


### Postprocessing

Make concatenated text with sentence-per-line format.

```
python make_sentlines.py out_txts > all.txt
```

If you want to tokenize them into segmented words by Microsoft's [BlingFire](https://github.com/Microsoft/BlingFire), run the below. You can use another choices for this by yourself.

```
python make_sentlines.py out_txts | python tokenize_sentlines.py > all.tokenized.txt
```

## Requirement

- python3 is recommended
- beautifulsoup4
- progressbar2
- blingfire
- html2text
- lxml

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Note on Errors

- It is expected some error messages are shown, e.g., `Failed: epub and txt`, `File is not a zip file` or `Failed to open`. But, the number of failures will be much less than one of successes. Don't worry.
